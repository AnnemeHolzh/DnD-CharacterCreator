The ability score section had a feature overhaul please make it look cohesive. (drop down menus especialy)
the Ability Circles are not aligned with their respective boxes
the Ability score selectors are not updating to show the falue after being selected 
please try to make it a bit smaller maybe the buttons for teh generation method can go on the side and be alot smaller
the ability score selectors dont update properly this will go in my TODO list as well so might be fixed unless i forgot
The skill sleection mode buttons (when one is selected its blue and ugly)
