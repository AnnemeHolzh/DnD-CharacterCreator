# Tools Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Tools section functionality according to D&D 5e rules, ensuring that tool proficiencies are correctly calculated based on class, race, and background rules.

## Functional Requirements Implemented

### ✅ Tool Proficiency Calculation Logic

**Class-based Tool Proficiencies:**
- **Bard**: Grants 3 musical instrument proficiencies
- **Rogue**: Grants Thieves' tools proficiency  
- **All other classes** (barbarian, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, sorcerer, warlock, wizard): Grant no tool proficiencies by default

**Background-based Tool Proficiencies:**
- **All backgrounds**: Always grant 2 tool proficiencies
- Updated backgrounds that had fewer than 2 tools to include "Artisan's tools" choices

**Race-based Tool Proficiencies:**
- **Dwarf subraces**: Add appropriate tool proficiencies granted by their subrace
- Hill Dwarf: mason's tools, brewer's supplies, smith's tools
- Mountain Dwarf: mason's tools, brewer's supplies, smith's tools
- Duergar: mason's tools, brewer's supplies, smith's tools

### ✅ Artisan's Tools Deduplication

**Implementation:**
- After compiling the total list of proficiencies, count how many times "artisan's tools" is listed
- Remove all "artisan's tools" entries from the fixed tools list
- Instead, allow the user to choose that many tool proficiencies from the artisan tools group
- Each "Artisan's tools" entry grants 1 choice from artisan's tools

### ✅ Frontend Tools Section Logic

**UI Features:**
- Present a list of all possible tool proficiencies with checkboxes
- Pre-check the boxes for tool proficiencies granted by the character's class, race, and background (excluding removed artisan's tools)
- Allow the user to manually select a number of proficiencies equal to the number of removed artisan's tools
- Enforce a selection cap: The user cannot select more proficiencies than the number allowed

**Visual Indicators:**
- Fixed proficiencies are marked with a lock icon and amber color
- Selected tools are marked with a green badge
- Artisan's tools are marked with a blue "Artisan" badge
- Tool choice allowances are clearly displayed
- Validation errors are shown when requirements are not met

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`lib/data/classes.ts`**
   - Updated all class tool proficiencies to match D&D 5e rules
   - Bard: 3 musical instruments
   - Rogue: thieves' tools
   - All others: empty arrays

2. **`lib/data/backgrounds.ts`**
   - Updated backgrounds to always grant 2 tool proficiencies
   - Added "Artisan's tools" to backgrounds that had fewer than 2 tools

3. **`lib/utils/character-utils.ts`**
   - Updated `ToolProficiencyData` interface to include `artisansToolChoices`
   - Modified `calculateToolProficiencies()` to separate fixed tools from artisan's tools choices
   - Updated `validateToolSelections()` to enforce artisan's tools requirements
   - Removed restriction that only artisan's tools could be selected

4. **`components/forms/tool-selector.tsx`**
   - Removed filtering to only show artisan's tools
   - Updated to show all tool categories
   - Added visual indicators for different tool types
   - Improved validation and error messaging
   - Enhanced tooltip information

### Key Functions

**`calculateToolProficiencies()`**
- Combines tool proficiencies from class, race, and background
- Separates fixed tools from "Artisan's tools" choices
- Returns both fixed tools and number of artisan's tool choices

**`validateToolSelections()`**
- Ensures fixed tools are selected
- Validates selection limits based on allowances
- Enforces artisan's tools requirements when applicable

**`calculateToolChoiceAllowances()`**
- Counts total tool choice allowances from all sources
- Each "Artisan's tools" entry grants 1 choice

## Test Results

The implementation was tested with various character combinations:

1. **Barbarian + Acolyte**: ✅ 0 fixed tools, 2 artisan choices
2. **Bard + Criminal**: ✅ 5 fixed tools (3 musical instruments + gaming set + thieves' tools), 0 artisan choices
3. **Rogue + Charlatan**: ✅ 3 fixed tools (thieves' tools + disguise kit + forgery kit), 0 artisan choices
4. **Hill Dwarf Barbarian + Acolyte**: ✅ 3 fixed tools (dwarf tools), 2 artisan choices

## User Experience

**Tool Selection Process:**
1. User selects their class, race, subrace, and background
2. Fixed tool proficiencies are automatically selected and locked
3. User sees how many additional tool choices they have
4. User can select from all available tools (not just artisan's tools)
5. If artisan's tools are required, the system enforces this requirement
6. Validation errors guide the user to make correct selections

**Visual Feedback:**
- Clear distinction between fixed and chosen tools
- Color-coded badges for different tool types
- Helpful tooltips with tool descriptions
- Real-time validation with error messages

## Compliance with D&D 5e Rules

✅ **Class Rules**: Each class grants the correct tool proficiencies
✅ **Background Rules**: All backgrounds grant exactly 2 tool proficiencies  
✅ **Race Rules**: Dwarf subraces grant appropriate tool proficiencies
✅ **Artisan's Tools**: Properly handled as choices rather than fixed tools
✅ **Validation**: Enforces all rules and prevents invalid selections

The Tools section now works correctly according to D&D 5e rules and provides an intuitive user experience for selecting tool proficiencies.
